Use something like this:

  Calculator.SendInput( TButton(Sender).Caption );
  edtDisplay.Text:=Calculator.GetDisplay;
end;
```

Enter this procedure name in OnClick event field.

And you are almost ready.

Don't forget to create and destroy the class:
```
procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Calculator:=TCalculator.Create;
end;

procedure TForm1.FormDestroy(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Calculator.Free;
end;
```

And also add the variable for the class to hold:
```
var
  Form1: TForm1;
  ...
  ...
  Calculator: TCalculator;
```

Just follow the example project and you'll be fine.
